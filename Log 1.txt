Everyone is overjoyed by the new inauguration of generation verse's first official project.  

This might actually change the course of our current way of thinking .... 

I am so glad to be a part of this project . Scott seems to be zoning out quite a lot today , when i asked him if 
everything was alright he just said "This was all just a huge mistake ....... Everyone here doesn't realise what catastrophe this is
going to lead to ." he just left after saying that .

I don't understand what he is on about right now . 

He probably is not interested in the project as much as we are ..... 
We are going through with this project 
whatever it takes. 

We must go through with it . 
Anyone who tries to stop us ..... well shall be removed .
